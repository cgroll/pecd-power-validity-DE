"""Download SMARD's monthly redispatch-by-energy-source series.

Since July 2022, SMARD publishes how much feed-in was reduced/increased
under Redispatch 2.0, broken down by energy carrier (wind onshore/offshore,
solar, and the conventional sources) -- monthly, national totals, no
per-TSO/per-plant detail. This is one of the two real-world curtailment
sources this project uses to explain the gap between PECD potential and
SMARD's reported generation (the other being `pkg/redispatch_measures.py`).

Adapted unchanged from ~/research/pecd-replication/pecdr/smard_redispatch.py.

This series has no documented API endpoint -- the frontend multiplexes
~130 different chart series into one shared CSV, selected client-side by a
`chart_id` column. That CSV's URL is a CoreMedia resource ID (e.g.
`/resource/blob/217306/-/data-csv-data.csv`) which rotates on site
republish, so it's resolved from the live topic-article page each run
rather than hardcoded: the page loads a shared `mod_urls.js` that defines
`URLS.data` to the current path -- the same two-hop lookup the browser
itself performs.
